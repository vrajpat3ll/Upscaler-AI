# TODOs

- Write a class for Neural Networks that can be scaled as much as we want to. 
- implement backpropagation.
- check the NeuralNetwork::cost() method, `nn.input()` is not restored at the end.

> Check for memory leaks/ allocation of memory where it is not expected to be allocated in the [`matrix.hpp`](./include/matrix.hpp) file.

- Make a Graphical User Interface so that we can actually see the network learn about the image.

- Add colour changing effect in the neurons and connections to see if network is learning or not.
